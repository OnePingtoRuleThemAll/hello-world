# hello-world

## GitHub practice
I will practice this as many times as I need to do so to understand how git and GitHub works so that I can be properly prepared for joining the work-force upon graduation. 
This is going to be a core skill when I graduate.

## Encouragement and a reminder to be kind to myself
I am extremely overwhelmed right now with everything I am learning but I can't wait to look back on this and smile. 
You can do this Jess. 
Everyone has to start somewhere.
